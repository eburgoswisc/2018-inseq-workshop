The microarray-based detection enabled quantitative analysis of mutant populations. The scalability of the approach enabled suppressor screens in which mutagenesis in specific mutant backgrounds revealed `entire networks of regulators

`Detailed methods have been published
<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18392960>`__ for conducting the TraSH protocol. Furthermore, `additional variations
<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17352919>`__ were developed later.

Limitations of the technique included designing and printing the microarray for each species/strain to be examined. Additionally, technical issues in microarray hybridization can present challenges.

*To combat these challenges...*
