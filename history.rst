Transposon sequencing is multiplex forward genetic analysis of bacterial genes in a competitive context.

The key requirement for a successful transposon sequencing study is opportunity for growth of the mutant library, such that mutants that

Important to note that transposon sequencing defines genes/operons required under a given condition, not necessarily genes that are expressed at a high level under that condition. In fact, a comparative study showed that transposon sequencing genes did not overlap substantially with highly-expressed genes as assayed by RNA-seq. This is worth thinking about as you
