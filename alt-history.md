# History

Transposon sequencing is multiplex forward genetic analysis of bacterial genes in a competitive context.



## Signature-tagged mutagenesis (1995)

As a result of the ability to assay multiple mutants in a multiplex fashion, the technique was widely adopted ([reviewed by Joan Mecsas](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11834366)). However, there are a number of technical obstacles that limited the utility of the technique:
- Assay of at most 96 mutants in each assay (limited by the hybridization approach).
- Tedious library construction: each well is derived from a different transposon.
- Not quantitative.
- Radiolabeling is required for detection.

*So on to multiplex hybridization...!*

## Microarray-based detection of mutants (2001)

Two groups simultaneously described this. One called it TraSH (transposon-site hybridization); the other didn't name it.

The microarray-based detection enabled quantitative analysis of mutant populations. "Version 2" analyses included doing suppressor screens in which mutagenesis in specific mutant backgrounds revealed [entire networks of regulators](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17941710).

> TRASH REVIEW??

Limitations of the technique included:
- Designing the initial microarray and printing them for each experiment.
- Technical issues in microarray hybridization, including comparing array to array.

*To combat these challenges...*

## Transposon sequencing (2009-)

At least four different groups developed technology to identify transposon insertion sites via short-read sequencing.
