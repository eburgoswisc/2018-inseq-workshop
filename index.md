# 2018 Transposon Insertion Sequencing Workshop

Instructor: Mark Mandel

## Day 1: Morning (9:30 am - 12:30 pm)

*Note: Part of Jetstream that we will use will be down starting at 10:00 am on Tuesday. Therefore, we will start right in on the hands-on portion, and tomorrow we will discuss more about the history & implementation of INSeq.*
